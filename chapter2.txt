And there it was
At the end of the rode
Waiting for me.

Now I realize 
That everything has an end
And at that moment
I knew mine has come

I would imagine
That I would be nervous
But I just felt 
an abrupt peace

No Fear, no anger
Non angst or overwhelming thoughts

Just Peace that came
From the union with the present
